        Hi, my name is Teddy. I'm Greek, and always looking for new experiences.
        My mantra is YOLO, you only live once. Skydiving, mountain climbing,
        hiking, and more. My YOLO list for 2019 is as follows: snowboarding,
        paragliding and more mountain climbing. Growing up eating greek food has
        turned me into a foodie and I'm thankful for that!
      </p>

        I used to fix computers since age 10. I didn't have a good experience
        with technical support so I took it upon myself to learn troubleshooting
        steps. The computer manual was there and I started reading. Fast forward
        a couple of years and I graduated with Computer Science degree at Queens
        College.

        Finding a job wasn't easy... Entry level positions with 3 years
        experience required while unreasonable were what I could find. After a
        few months of searching I finally found a technical support position at
        Columbia Psychiatry. It was a volunteer job but I was greatful to earn
        some experiance.

        After 6 months, I was offered a job and from there I was working above
        my pay grade. Building image servers, MBAM servers and assistiing with
        administrative tasks. I was up for anything. I was very lucky that there
        were co-workers that appreciated my help and would help me in return.
        Unfortunately, opportunities for advancement within were not readily
        available and I had no choice but to look for another job. Finally,
        within about 2 months I recieved three offers for an administrator
        positions. I currently work as a systems engineer/administrator for a
        Managed Service Provider. We manage over 180 clients, mainly in finance.
